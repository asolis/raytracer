###A stochastic path tracer for direct and indirect illumination with simple geometries and basic lighting.

The complete set of features implemented in this project is the following:  Monte Carlo integration, Russian Roulette, ray-object intersections, light-emitting objects (luminaires), indirect illumination, direct illumination, hyper-threading, camera model (perspective and parallel projection), antialiasing, exposure, important sampling, scene parser, and materials (Lambertian, specular, imperfect specular, smooth dialectric, and diffuse-specular surfaces).
